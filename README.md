# Haskell-Minesweeper-Robot-Project

Prompt:

In this project you are going to implement the AI module for a minesweeper robot in Haskell. The environment in which the robot operates is an 4 × 4 grid of cells. Initially, a cell on the grid is either empty, contains the robot, or contains a mine. The robot can move in all four directions and is able to collect a mine only if it is in the same cell as the mine. Your program will take as input the initial position of the robot and the positions of all of the mines. The objective of the AI module is to compute a sequence of actions that the robot can follow in order to go to all the mines and collect them. For example, assume that the robot R starts at (3,0) while the mines are at (2,2) and (1,2). One possible generated sequence of actions by your program is: ["up","right","right","collect","up","collect"]. As a bonus optimize your implementation to solve grids bigger than 4×4 with more mines. To do this, you are allowed to define any types you need and/or change any type definition of any function other than solve.
